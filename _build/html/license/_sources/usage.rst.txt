Usage

.. highlight:: none

If running on Cori, it is preferable to run from ``$CSCRATCH`` rather than
``/global/homes``. Running from the latter may result in a
'Resource temporarily unavailable' error.

.. note::
    If you have not logged into HSI before, you will have to do so before running ``zstash`` with HPSS.
    On NERSC machines, just run ``hsi`` on the command line and enter your credentials.

.. warning::
    When specifying files, wildcards should be enclosed in double quotes (e.g., ``"a*"``).

.. warning::
    Specifying a high number for ``--workers`` will result in slow downloads for each of the tars since your bandwidth
    is limited. User discretion is advised.

Create
======

To create a new zstash archive: ::

   $ zstash create --hpss=<path to HPSS> <local path>

where

* ``--hpss=<path to HPSS>`` specifies the destination path on the HPSS file 
  system where the archive files will be stored. This directory should be **unique** for each 
  zstash archive. If ``--hpss=none``, then files will be archived locally instead of being
  transferred to HPSS. The ``none`` option should be used when running Zstash on a machine
  without HPSS.
* ``<local path>`` specifies the path to the local directory that should be archived.

Additional optional arguments:

* ``--cache`` to use a cache other than the default of ``zstash``. If hpss is ``--hpss=none``, then this will be the archive.
* ``--exclude`` comma separated list of file patterns to exclude
* ``--keep`` to keep a copy of the tar files on the local file system after 
  they have been transferred to HPSS. Normally, they are deleted after 
  successful transfer.
* ``--maxsize MAXSIZE`` specifies the maximum size (in GB) for tar files. 
  The default is 256 GB. Zstash will create tar files that are smaller 
  than MAXSIZE except when individual input files exceed MAXSIZE (as 
  individual files are never split up between different tar files).
* ``-v`` increases output verbosity.

Local tar files as well as the sqlite3 index database (index.db) will be stored
under ``<local path>/zstash``.

**After you run** ``zstash create`` **it's highly recommended that you
run** ``zstash check``, **detailed in the section below.**

Basic example
-------------

To **archive** output from an E3SM simulation located
under `$CSCRATCH/ACME_simulations/20170731.F20TR.ne30_ne30.edison`::

  $ cd $CSCRATCH/ACME_simulations/20170731.F20TR.ne30_ne30.edison
  $ zstash create --hpss=test/E3SM_simulations/20170731.F20TR.ne30_ne30.edison .

Once done, you should see the archive files on hsi: ::

  $ hsi
  > cd test/E3SM_simulations/20170731.F20TR.ne30_ne30.edison
  > ls 
  000000.tar   index.db

The data from this test simulation is small, so in this case there is only a single tar 
file (000000.tar) and the index database (index.db).

Examples excluding some files
-----------------------------

You may decide that certain files do not need to be archived.
For example, if you want to **exclude \*.o and \*.mod files** under the build
subdirectory: ::

  $ cd $CSCRATCH/ACME_simulations/20170731.F20TR.ne30_ne30.edison
  $ zstash create --hpss=test/ACME_simulations/20170731.F20TR.ne30_ne30.edison \
    --exclude="build/*/*.o","build/*/*.mod" .

Or you may decide that you only want to **archive restart files every 5 years**
to conserve storage space: ::

  $ cd $CSCRATCH/ACME_simulations/20170731.F20TR.ne30_ne30.edison
  $ zstash create --hpss=test/ACME_simulations/20170731.F20TR.ne30_ne30.edison \
    --exclude="archive/rest/???[!05]-*/" .

This exclude pattern will skip all restart subdirectories under the short-term archive,
except for those with years ending in '0' or '5'.


Check
=====

Note: Most of the commands for this are the same for ``zstash extract`` and ``zstash ls``.

To verify that your files were uploaded on HPSS successfully,
go to a **new, empty directory** and run: ::

   $ zstash check --hpss=<path to HPSS> [--workers=<num of processes>] [--cache=<cache>] [--keep] [-v] [files]

where

* ``--hpss=<path to HPSS>`` specifies the destination path on the HPSS file system.
* ``--workers=<num of processes>`` an optional argument which specifies the number of
  processes to use, resulting in checking being done in parallel.
  **Using a high number will result in slow downloads for each of the tars since your bandwidth is limited.**
  **User discretion is advised.**
* ``--cache`` to use a cache other than the default of ``zstash``.
* ``--keep`` to keep a copy of the tar files on the local file system after
  they have been extracted from the archive. Normally, they are deleted after
  successful transfer.
* ``-v`` increases output verbosity.
* ``[files]`` is a list of files to check (standard wildcards supported).

  * Leave empty to check all the files.
  * List of files with support for wildcards. Please note that any expression
    containing **wildcards should be enclosed in double quotes ("...")** 
    to avoid shell substitution.
  * Names of specific tar archives to check all files within these tar archives.


``zstash check`` will download the tar archives to the local disk cache (under 
the `zstash/` subdirectory) and verify the md5 checksum against the checksum 
stored in the index database (`index.db`).

After the check is complete, a list of all corrupted files in the HPSS archive,
along with the tar archive they belong is listed. Below is an example:  ::

    INFO: Opening tar archive zstash/000000.tar
    INFO: Checking archive/atm/hist/20180129.DECKv1b_piControl.ne30_oEC.edison.cam.h0.0001-01.nc

If you encounter an error, **save your original data**.
You may need to reupload it via ``zstash create``.
Please contact the zstash development team, we're working on
identifying what causes these issues.

Update
======

An existing zstash archive can be updated to add new or modified files: ::

   $ cd <mydir>
   $ zstash update --hpss=<path to HPSS> [--cache=<cache>] [--dry-run] [--exclude] [--keep] [-v]

where

* ``--hpss=<path to HPSS>`` specifies the destination path on the HPSS file system,
* ``--cache`` to use a cache other than the default of ``zstash``.
* ``--dry-run`` an optional argument to specify a dry run, only lists files to be updated in archive.
* ``--exclude`` an optional argument of comma separated list of file patterns to exclude
* ``--keep`` to keep a copy of the tar files on the local file system after
  they have been extracted from the archive. Normally, they are deleted after
  successful transfer.
* ``-v`` increases output verbosity.

Note: in the event that an update includes revisions to files previously archived, ``zstash update``
will archive the new revisions. ``zstah extract`` will only extract the latest revision, but all
file versions will still be listed with the ``zstash ls`` and ``zstash ls -l`` commands.

Starting with ``zstash v1.1.0`` the md5 hash for the tars will be computed on ``zstash create``.
If you're using an existing database, then ``zstash update`` will begin keeping track
of the tars automatically.

Example
-------

Following the '**zstash create**' example above, we now run zstash again with the 
'**update**' functionality: ::

  $ cd $CSCRATCH/ACME_simulations/20170731.F20TR.ne30_ne30.edison
  $ zstash update --hpss=test/ACME_simulations/20170731.F20TR.ne30_ne30.edison

Since nothing has changed, zstash simply returns ::

  INFO: Nothing to update

Now, let's add a new file ::

  $ mkdir new
  $ echo "This is a new file..." > new/file.txt

and rerun zstash update ::

  $ zstash update --hpss=test/ACME_simulations/20170731.F20TR.ne30_ne30.edison

Zstash recognizes the presence of a new file and adds it to the archive: ::

  INFO: Gathering list of files to archive
  INFO: Creating new tar archive 000001.tar
  INFO: Archiving new/file.txt
  DEBUG: Closing tar archive 000001.tar
  INFO: Transferring file to HPSS: zstash/000001.tar
  INFO: Transferring file to HPSS: zstash/index.db

Note that the new file is added into a new archive tar file (000001.tar) even 
though the first archive tar file (000000.tar) is smaller than the target size 
and therefore could potentially hold more data. This is a design choice that 
was made out of caution to avoid the risk of damaging an existing tar file by 
appending to it.


Extract
=======

Note: Most of the commands for this are the same for ``zstash check`` and ``zstash ls``.

To extract files from an existing zstash archive into current <mydir>: ::

   $ cd <mydir>
   $ zstash extract --hpss=<path to HPSS> [--workers=<num of processes>] [--cache=<cache>] [--keep] [-v] [files]

where

* ``--hpss=<path to HPSS>`` specifies the destination path on the HPSS file system.
  Note that if ``--hpss=none``, then ``--keep`` is automatically set to ``True``.
* ``--workers=<num of processes>`` an optional argument which specifies the number of
  processes to use, resulting in extracting being done in parallel.
  **Using a high number will result in slow downloads for each of the tars since your bandwidth is limited.**
  **User discretion is advised.**
* ``--cache`` to use a cache other than the default of ``zstash``.
* ``--keep`` to keep a copy of the tar files on the local file system after
  they have been extracted from the archive. Normally, they are deleted after
  successful transfer.
* ``-v`` increases output verbosity.
* ``[files]`` is a list of files to be extracted (standard wildcards supported).

  * Leave empty to extract all the files.
  * List of files with support for wildcards. Please note that any expression
    containing **wildcards should be enclosed in double quotes ("...")** 
    to avoid shell substitution.
  * Names of specific tar archives to extract all files within these tar archives.

You must pass in the **path relative to the top level** for the file(s). For help 
finding path names, you can use ``zstash ls`` as documented below.

A few words about performance. All of the files are grouped into 256GB tar archives by default.
(See the ``--maxsize`` argument for ``zstash create`` for more information).
If the tar file is not already present in the local disk cache (under 
the ``zstash/`` sub-directory), it must first be downloaded from HPSS before
the desired file can be extracted.

  * Downloading a 256GB file on Cori/Edison takes about 30 mins (or more depending on load).
  * Using NERSC data transfer nodes (DTN) may be about 3x faster, according to some users.
  * Again, to see which of your files are in what tar archives, use ``zstash ls -l``.

    * Note the ``-l`` argument.
    * The sixth column is the tar archive that the file is in.
    * Please see the List documentation below for more information.


Examples

      DEBUG: Closing tar archive zstash/000018.tar
      DEBUG: Closing index database

If the index database is already in the local disk cache (zstash/index.db), you can leave out the ``--hpss``
path. For example: ::

      $ zstash extract archive/logs/atm.log.8229335.180130-143234.gz

However, recall that wildcards are supported, so this full path isn't needed when using them.
Instead, you could download files matching ``"*atm.log.8229335.180130-143234.gz*"``. Note
the use of double quotes (") to avoid shell level substitution. ::
  
      $ zstash extract --hpss=/home/g/golaz/2018/E3SM_simulations/20180129.DECKv1b_piControl.ne30_oEC.edison "*atm.log.8229335.180130-143234.gz*"

      DEBUG: Closing tar archive zstash/000047.tar
      DEBUG: Closing index database

In this particular example, the pattern matches two specific files, one under `archive/logs/`
and another one under `case_scripts/logs/`. If you didn't intend to retrieve both of them, a
more efficient approach would have been to first identify the desired files with 'zstash ls'.

Another example of wildcards would be to retrieve all **cam.h0** (monthly atmosphere output files) 
between **years 0030 and 0069** for the DECKv1 piControl simulation. The zstash command would be: ::

   $ zstash extract --hpss=/home/g/golaz/2018/E3SM_simulations/20180129.DECKv1b_piControl.ne30_oEC.edison \
            "*.cam.h0.00[3-6]?-??.nc"


You may specify the cache with the ``--cache`` option. Notice that there is no need to include
``--keep`` when not using HPSS. ::

  $ zstash extract --hpss=none \
  --cache=/p/user_pub/e3sm/archive/1_1/BGC-v1/20181217.BCRC_CNPCTC20TR_OIBGC.ne30_oECv3.edison \
  "*cam.h3.1906-01-*-*.nc"

.. _zstash-list:

List
====

Note: Most of the commands for this are the same for ``zstash extract`` and ``zstash check``.

You can view the files in an existing zstash archive:  ::

   $ zstash ls --hpss=<path to HPSS> [-l] [--cache=<cache>] [--tars] [-v] [files]

where

* ``--hpss=<path to HPSS>`` specifies the destination path on the HPSS file system,
* ``-l`` an optional argument to display more information.
* ``--cache`` to use a cache other than the default of ``zstash``.
* ``--tars`` to list the tars in addition to the files.
* ``-v`` increases output verbosity.
* ``[files]`` is a list of files to be listed (standard wildcards supported).

  * Leave empty to list all the files.
  * List of files with support for wildcards. Please note that any expression
    containing **wildcards should be enclosed in double quotes ("...")** 
    to avoid shell substitution.
  * Names of specific tar archives to list all files within these tar archives.

Below is an example. Note the names of the columns:  ::

   $ zstash ls -l --hpss=/home/g/golaz/2018/E3SM_simulations/20180129.DECKv1b_piControl.ne30_oEC.edison "*atm.log.8229335.180130-143234.gz*"

.. warning::
    Running ``zstash ls`` outside the source directory (the directory you're archiving)
    is not advised. ``zstash`` will only retrieve ``index.db`` from the HPSS archive
    if a local archive (cache) is not present.

Example 1 -- changing the HPSS archive: ::

    $ zstash create --hpss=hpss_archive source_directory           # Creates an HPSS archive named `hpss_archive` and a local archive (cache) `source_directory/zstash`.
    $ zstash ls --hpss=hpss_archive                                # List the contents of `hpss_archive` and creates a cache `zstash` at the same level of `source_directory`.
    # Add `source_directory/new_file.txt`
    $ zstash create --hpss=different_hpss_archive source_directory # Create a different HPSS archive of the source directory. This overwrites the local archive (cache) `source_directory/zstash`.
    $ zstash ls --hpss=different_hpss_archive                      # `new_file.txt` will NOT be shown. The existing cache `zstash` (same level as `source_directory`) is being used.
    $ rm -rf zstash                                                # Delete the cache. (You could instead change to another directory).
    $ zstash ls --hpss=different_hpss_archive                      # `new_file.txt` will be shown.

Example 2 -- updating the HPSS archive: ::

    $ zstash create --hpss=hpss_archive source_directory # Creates an HPSS archive named `hpss_archive` and a local archive (cache) `source_directory/zstash`.
    $ zstash ls --hpss=hpss_archive                      # List the contents of `hpss_archive` and creates a cache `zstash` at the same level of `source_directory`.
    # Add `source_directory/new_file.txt`
    $ cd source_directory
    $ zstash update --hpss=hpss_archive                  # Add `new_file.txt` to the HPSS archive. This updates the cache `zstash` (in `source_directory`).
    $ cd ..
    $ zstash ls --hpss=hpss_archive                      # `new_file.txt` will NOT be shown. The existing cache `zstash` (same level as `source_directory`) is being used.
    $ rm -rf zstash                                      # Delete the cache. (You could instead change to another directory).
    $ zstash ls --hpss=hpss_archive                      # `new_file.txt` will be shown.

Example 3 -- changing the HPSS archive, running ``zstash_ls`` from the source directory: ::

    $ zstash create --hpss=hpss_archive source_directory           # Creates an HPSS archive named `hpss_archive` and a local archive (cache) `source_directory/zstash`.
    $ cd source_directory                                          # This is the directory we are archiving.
    $ zstash ls --hpss=hpss_archive                                # List the contents of `hpss_archive` and uses the existing cache `zstash` (in `source_directory`).
    # Add `new_file.txt`
    $ cd ..
    $ zstash create --hpss=different_hpss_archive source_directory # Create a different HPSS archive of the source directory. This overwrites the local archive (cache) `source_directory/zstash`.
    $ cd source_directory
    $ zstash ls --hpss=different_archive                           # `new_file.txt` will be shown.

Example 4 -- updating the HPSS archive, running ``zstash_ls`` from the source directory: ::

    $ zstash create --hpss=hpss_archive source_directory # Creates an HPSS archive named `hpss_archive` and a local archive (cache) `source_directory/zstash`.
    $ cd source_directory                                # This is the directory we are archiving.
    $ zstash ls --hpss=hpss_archive                      # List the contents of `hpss_archive` and uses the existing cache `zstash` (in `source_directory`).
    # Add new_file.txt
    $ zstash update --hpss=hpss_archive                  # Add `new_file.txt` to the HPSS archive. This updates the cache `zstash` (in `source_directory`).
    $ zstash ls --hpss=hpss_archive                      # `new_file.txt` will be shown.

Version
=======

Starting with version 0.3, you can check the version of zstash from the command line: ::

   $ zstash version
   v0.3.0
